# reactvr-swapi


Dependencides:
You need to have https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql installed

To run:

```javascript
// in swapi console
# npm start
// take the port number it provides and plug that into index.vr.js

# npm i
# npm start
// open at http://localhost:8081/vr/
```

In index.vr.js you can swap out the MainSceneN files to see various stages I showed in the presentation.
